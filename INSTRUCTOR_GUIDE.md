## Talking Points & Script

### **Opening (0:00-1:00)**

> "Welcome to the DPoP Hands-On Lab! Today we're going to build a secure browser identity system that demonstrates proof-of-possession. This is cutting-edge security technology that's being adopted by major platforms and enterprises.
> 
> **Why is this important?** Traditional authentication relies on passwords and tokens that can be stolen. DPoP provides cryptographic proof that the client actually possesses the key, making attacks much harder.
> 
> **What we'll build:** A complete system with browser identity keys, DPoP binding, passkey authentication, and cross-device linking - all in 30 minutes!"

### **Setup Explanation (1:00-3:00)**

> "Let's look at our lab application. We have a simple web app with a basic UI and a Python FastAPI backend. The key files are:
> 
> - `index.html` - Our main interface
> - `app.js` - Main application logic with TODO comments (we'll implement this)
> - `app-complete.js` - Complete implementation for reference
> - `server.py` - Backend API (already implemented)
> - `utils.js` - Helper functions (we'll use these)
> 
> **The lab application provides:**
> - Basic UI with buttons for each step
> - TODO comments in `app.js` for guided implementation
> - Server endpoints for authentication
> - Utility functions for crypto operations
> - IndexedDB setup for secure storage
> 
> **Implementation approach:**
> - Each method contains TODO comments with hints
> - Students implement one step at a time
> - Detailed logging shows what's happening
> - Reference implementation available if needed"

### **Step 1: BIK Registration (5:00-10:00)**

> "**Step 1: Browser Identity Key Registration**
> 
> First, we need to establish a unique identity for this browser. We'll generate a cryptographic key pair that can never leave the browser - this is our Browser Identity Key (BIK).
> 
> **Key concepts:**
> - Non-exportable keys using Web Crypto API
> - Secure storage in IndexedDB
> - Key thumbprint for identification
> 
> **Implementation:**
> 1. Generate EC key pair with `crypto.subtle.generateKey()`
> 2. Store in IndexedDB using the provided utilities
> 3. Send public key to server for registration
> 4. Server validates and stores key thumbprint"

**Common Questions:**
- *"Why can't we export the private key?"* - Security! If it could be exported, it could be stolen.
- *"What's a key thumbprint?"* - A unique identifier derived from the public key.

### **Step 2: DPoP Binding (10:00-15:00)**

> "**Step 2: DPoP Binding**
> 
> Now we'll create a DPoP proof that cryptographically binds our browser identity to a session token. This prevents token theft and replay attacks.
> 
> **Key concepts:**
> - DPoP tokens are JWTs with specific claims
> - `jti` (JWT ID) must be unique per request
> - `htm` (HTTP method) and `htu` (HTTP URI) prevent replay
> - `iat` (issued at) prevents timing attacks
> 
> **Implementation:**
> 1. Generate a new DPoP key pair
> 2. Create DPoP JWT with required claims
> 3. Send to server for binding
> 4. Server issues binding token"

**Common Questions:**
- *"Why do we need a separate DPoP key?"* - Separation of concerns. BIK is for identity, DPoP is for session binding.
- *"What prevents replay attacks?"* - The `jti` must be unique, and `htm`/`htu` must match the actual request.

### **Step 3: WebAuthn Integration (15:00-20:00)**

> "**Step 3: WebAuthn Passkey Support**
> 
> Now we'll add passwordless authentication using the device's biometric authenticator or security key. This eliminates password vulnerabilities.
> 
> **Key concepts:**
> - WebAuthn uses public key cryptography
> - User verification (biometric, PIN, etc.)
> - Attestation for key authenticity
> - Cross-platform compatibility
> 
> **Implementation:**
> 1. Check WebAuthn support
> 2. Get registration options from server
> 3. Create credentials with `navigator.credentials.create()`
> 4. Send attestation to server for verification"

**Common Questions:**
- *"What if the device doesn't have biometrics?"* - WebAuthn supports security keys, PINs, and other verification methods.
- *"How does this work across devices?"* - Passkeys can be synced via cloud providers or used with security keys.

### **Step 4: Cross-Device Linking (20:00-25:00)**

> "**Step 4: Cross-Device Linking**
> 
> Finally, we'll implement secure communication between devices. This enables VDI environments and step-up authentication scenarios.
> 
> **Key concepts:**
> - QR codes for easy device pairing
> - WebSocket for real-time communication
> - Cryptographic verification of device identity
> - Secure data sharing between devices
> 
> **Implementation:**
> 1. Generate QR code with linking URL
> 2. Establish WebSocket connection
> 3. Exchange device information securely
> 4. Enable real-time data sharing"

**Common Questions:**
- *"How is this secure?"* - Each device has its own identity keys, and communication is cryptographically verified.
- *"What about network security?"* - WebSocket connections use TLS, and we add additional cryptographic verification.

### **Testing & Wrap-up (25:00-30:00)**

> "**Testing Our Implementation**
> 
> Let's test the complete flow:
> 1. Initialize session
> 2. Register BIK
> 3. Bind DPoP
> 4. Register passkey
> 5. Test cross-device linking
> 
> **Real-world applications:**
> - Enterprise SSO with device binding
> - Financial services with step-up authentication
> - Healthcare applications with device verification
> - IoT device management
> 
> **Key security benefits:**
> - No passwords to steal
> - Tokens can't be replayed
> - Device identity is cryptographically proven
> - Cross-device communication is secure"
